<p>To the Most Excellent Deputies and Senators of the Italian Republic</p>
<p>Subject: Expression of Repudiation of the Tajani Decree-Law of 03/28/2025</p>

<p>Most Excellent Parliamentary Members,</p>

<p>I respectfully address Your Excellencies to express my deep concern and vehement repudiation of the Tajani Decree-Law, enacted on March 28, 2025, which imposes severe restrictions on the recognition of Italian citizenship for descendants. This measure significantly affects thousands of families, including mine, and represents an unjustified distancing from the historical, cultural, and emotional ties between Italy and its global diaspora.</p>

<p>I acknowledge the difficulties faced by the Italian administration in light of the growing demand for citizenship recognition, as well as the problems related to fraud and irregular activities perpetrated by opportunistic groups. However, imposing the same penalties on us, legitimate descendants who preserve and honor Italian culture, history, traditions, and values, constitutes a disproportionate, unfair, and incompatible decision with the fundamental principles of the Italian Republic and its rich history of welcoming its children scattered around the world.</p>

<p>I respectfully present the fundamental reasons why this Decree-Law deserves reconsideration or, at the very least, a transition period to allow legitimate descendants to adapt to the new requirements:</p>

<h3>1. Disproportionate Barrier to Citizenship Access for Legitimate Descendants</h3>
<p>The Decree-Law imposes excessively stringent requirements on descendants with a legitimate right to citizenship, establishing bureaucratic criteria that ignore the historical context of Italian emigration. Many families face significant obstacles in accessing old documentation and have invested considerable financial resources, often saved over years, to complete this process. The new requirements make recognition practically unviable for thousands of descendants who have always maintained deep ties with Italy or who seek to reclaim their cultural heritage and contribute to Italy's socioeconomic development.</p>

<h3>2. Disregard for the Reality of Descendants Abroad</h3>
<p>Many of us grew up in environments where Italian identity was preserved and celebrated daily through language, cuisine, family traditions, and respect for ancestral roots. The new Decree-Law, instead of strengthening these identity ties, creates an artificial divide, denying official recognition to those who genuinely honor and perpetuate Italianness in their daily lives, often under challenging circumstances in distant countries.</p>

<h3>3. Inadequate Approach to the Fraud Problem</h3>
<p>The existence of issues related to corruption and fraud in citizenship recognition processes is undeniable. However, the solution should not indiscriminately penalize all descendants. The Italian Republic has legal and administrative mechanisms to combat such irregularities precisely and effectively without harming those seeking citizenship recognition through legitimate and transparent means.</p>

<h3>4. Cultural and Economic Harm to Italy</h3>
<p>Descendants of Italians not only carry an emotional bond with Italy but also actively contribute to the preservation and dissemination of its culture, in addition to generating positive impacts on the Italian economy through tourism, investments, academic and professional exchanges, or even by choosing to reside and work in the country. Restricting access to citizenship means alienating thousands of potential cultural and economic ambassadors who wish to strengthen and enrich the Italian nation, rather than merely benefiting from circumstantial advantages.</p>

<h3>5. Contradiction with Constitutional Principles and Italian Legal Traditions</h3>
<p>The Tajani Decree-Law contradicts fundamental principles of equality and justice enshrined in the Italian Constitution, establishing arbitrary criteria that deny legitimate rights based on ancestry. Italian citizenship, traditionally grounded in the principle of jus sanguinis, should not be conceived as a discretionary political concession but as a legal recognition of historical, cultural, and familial ties that transcend geographical boundaries.</p>
<br>
<p>In light of the above, I formally express my repudiation of the Tajani Decree-Law and request its urgent reconsideration by the Italian Parliament. The most appropriate path is not to distance Italians by blood from their ancestral homeland but to strengthen mechanisms that ensure a transparent, efficient, and fair recognition process, preserving the dignity and rights of descendants who keep the connection with Italy alive around the world.</p>
<br>
<p>I appreciate your attention and trust in the sensitivity of Your Excellencies to consider this appeal with due seriousness, aiming to continuously strengthen the bonds between Italy and its global diaspora, guided by respect, justice, and mutual recognition.</p>
<br>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
